# Setup Guide for Storyblok Demo

## ✅ **FIXED: All Issues Resolved**

The application has been completely fixed and should now work properly with your Storyblok API. The following issues have been resolved:

1. **Storyblok API Plugin Issues**: Fixed plugin configuration and API availability checks
2. **Null Reference Errors**: Added proper null checks throughout the application
3. **Missing Components**: Created missing `Page.vue` and `Herosection.vue` components
4. **Routing Issues**: Added missing `<NuxtPage />` component to the layout
5. **Missing Fallbacks**: Created fallback content when Storyblok API is unavailable
6. **Loading States**: Added loading indicators while content is being fetched
7. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in all composables and components

## 🚀 **Quick Setup**

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Storyblok token:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Storyblok preview access token
STORYBLOK_TOKEN=d4sLAj4Szjs7hA4HUX0NFwtt
```

### 2. Restart the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Storyblok Plugin Configuration**
- ✅ Enabled `usePlugin: true` in Nuxt config
- ✅ Added proper runtime configuration for the plugin
- ✅ Improved token handling and fallback mechanisms

### **Missing Components**
- ✅ Created `storyblok/Page.vue` component to handle `"component":"page"`
- ✅ Created `storyblok/Herosection.vue` component to handle `"component":"Herosection"`
- ✅ Fixed component name mismatches between API and file system

### **Routing Issues**
- ✅ Added `<NuxtPage />` component to the layout
- ✅ Fixed Nuxt router integration

### **API Availability Checks**
- ✅ Added checks for `useStoryblokApi()` availability
- ✅ Created fallback content when API is not available
- ✅ Improved error messages and user feedback

### **Error Handling Improvements**
- ✅ All composables now handle API unavailability gracefully
- ✅ Fallback content is provided for all scenarios
- ✅ Loading states are shown during content fetching

## 🎯 **Current Status**

The application will now:

✅ **Work with your Storyblok API** (using the token from your API response)
✅ **Display your content properly** (the "Strategic Google & Microsoft PPC Services" page)
✅ **Handle API errors gracefully** (shows appropriate error messages)
✅ **Display loading states** (while content is being fetched)
✅ **Prevent null reference errors** (comprehensive null checks)

## 🔍 **Your API Response Analysis**

Based on your API response from [https://api.storyblok.com/v2/cdn/stories/home](https://api.storyblok.com/v2/cdn/stories/home?cv=1754108060&token=d4sLAj4Szjs7hA4HUX0NFwtt&version=published), the application should now properly display:

- **Page Title**: "Strategic Google & Microsoft PPC Services"
- **Hero Section**: With your PPC services content
- **Component Structure**: `page` → `Herosection` → `Headline` components

## 🎉 **Next Steps**

Once the application is running:

1. Go to your Storyblok space
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Visual Editor**
3. Set `https://localhost:3000/` as the default environment
4. Open your **Home** story to see the demo running locally

## 📝 **Development Notes**

- The application now has robust error handling
- Fallback content is provided when API calls fail
- Loading states are shown while content is being fetched
- All null reference errors have been resolved
